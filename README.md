  ## Description 

  This application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.  

  ### User Story

  AS A manager  
  I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info  
  SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles  

  ### Acceptance Criteria

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
  WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information  
  THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input  
  WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML    
  THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address  
  WHEN I click on the GitHub username  
  THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab  
  WHEN I start the application  
  THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number  
  WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number  
  THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team  
  WHEN I select the engineer option  
  THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu  
  WHEN I select the intern option  
  THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu  
  WHEN I decide to finish building my team  
  THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
